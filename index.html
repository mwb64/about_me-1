    <h1>About Me...</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Trevor Dobson, I'm going to tell you a little about myself.  I am originally from a small town in Iowa.  After high school I attended Iowa State University.  After some fun years of living the college life, I graduated with a degree in business.  This is when you typically go out and start your career.  Not me, this is when I decided to join the Army as an infantryman.  During my time in the Army I spent time in Georgia, North Carolina, and Washington.  Washington would be where I finally stopped and called it home.  I met my wife, deployed to Afghanistan, and then had my daughter who is 4 now.  I got out of the Army bounced around a few jobs, couldnâ€™t find anything I enjoyed so I decided to drop everything and learn coding.</p>
